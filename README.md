KeyVal
======

Lightweight, greppable text database for key-value pairs.

The core code is written in C, but I've tried to make it easy to run it through
SWIG to use from any language you want.

Apologies for not having an autoconf script for building; at the moment all
you get is my rather OSX-specific Makefile.
